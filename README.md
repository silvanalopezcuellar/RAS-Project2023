# RAS-Project2023

The project consisted of controlling a drone's flying direction according to the image analysis to cross three different gates. The first gate was identified with 4 Arauco markers, that were used for the image analysis with the corners and IDs of the markers. The second gate was a completely green square analyzed based on the color. The third gate was the corners of a square with a green color. The video attached to the project shows the result.
